## 🧩 Boilerplate Architecture

- **Project Structure**: Tactical DDD with bounded contexts, hexagonal architecture (domain/application/adapter layers)
- **Persistence**: MyBatis 3.x + PostgreSQL 17 + Liquibase for schema migrations
- **Messaging**: RabbitMQ consumer/publisher pattern
- **Security**: Spring Security + OAuth2 Resource Server (RS256 JWT)
- **Infrastructure**: Multi-stage Docker builds, tiered Docker Compose setup
- **Observability**: Micrometer, Prometheus, Grafana, and structured JSON logging
- **Quality Tools**: Checkstyle, JaCoCo, ArchUnit, and conventional commits

> See [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) for detailed project structure and DDD patterns.
