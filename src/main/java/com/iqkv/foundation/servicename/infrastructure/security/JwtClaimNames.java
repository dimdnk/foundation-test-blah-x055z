 * JWT claim name constants for this service.

 * claim set is defined there. Only declare the claims this service actually reads.
 *
 * <p>The IAM access token carries these platform claims (snake_case throughout):
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@code sub} — user email (standard claim)</li>
 *   <li>{@code iss} — {@code "foundation-iam-service"} (standard claim)</li>
 *   <li>{@code iat}, {@code exp}, {@code jti} — standard claims</li>
 *   <li>{@code type} — {@code "access"} or {@code "refresh"}</li>
 *   <li>{@code user_id} — UUID string</li>
 *   <li>{@code email} — user email</li>
 *   <li>{@code first_name}, {@code last_name}</li>
 *   <li>{@code tenant_id} — 8-character NanoID; absent on platform-admin tokens</li>
 *   <li>{@code authorities} — list of granted authority strings</li>
 *   <li>{@code email_verified}, {@code onboarding_completed}, {@code profile_completed}</li>
 *   <li>{@code plan_code} — optional; absent when no active subscription</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Most services only need {@code tenant_id} and {@code authorities} directly — the rest
 * arrive via headers injected by the gateway ({@code X-User-ID}, {@code X-User-Email},
 * {@code X-Tenant-ID}, {@code X-Plan-Code}, {@code X-User-Authorities}).
