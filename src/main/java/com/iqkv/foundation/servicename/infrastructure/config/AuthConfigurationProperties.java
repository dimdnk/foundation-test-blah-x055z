/**
 * Binds {@code iqkv.auth.*} from {@code application.yml}.
 *
 * <p>This service is a JWT resource server — it only needs to verify tokens issued by the IAM
 * service. It does not issue tokens and therefore does not hold a private key.
 *
 * <p>Two mutually-exclusive verification strategies are supported:
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>JWKS URI</b> ({@code jwks-uri}) — preferred for deployed (K8s) environments.
 *       Keys are fetched from {@code foundation-iam-service/.well-known/jwks.json} and cached
 *       locally. New keys are picked up automatically on key rotation without redeployment.</li>
 *   <li><b>Local PEM</b> ({@code public-key-path}) — for local development and tests.
 *       Accepts {@code classpath:} or {@code file:} resources. Use this when the IAM service
 *       is not reachable (e.g. unit/integration tests running in isolation).</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Exactly one of {@code jwks-uri} or {@code public-key-path} must be non-blank. An
 * {@link IllegalStateException} is thrown at startup if both or neither are configured.
 *
 * <p>The full auth config (expiry, refresh, security, password-reset, magic-link) lives in the
 * IAM service. Add those sub-records here only if this service ever needs to issue its own tokens.
